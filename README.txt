This is a fan made website about the game/ serie Bang Dream Girls Band Party

This website is for school, only html, css and javascript, no div or span and no library's

The website will never sell anything on it, the webshop is purely a mock webshop

Changes in the code may not be visible on the website itself, because I delay pushing the changes to firebase until I'm certain the commits work

Features currently in the working:

-Webshop item tracker/ order form
-Fix the console bug in every page that doesn't contain a searchbar

Features that will be worked on in the near future:

-Song page
-Information page about all the webshop items
-Fix the footer
-Fix the file structure (a css file for every page)
-Fix the font on mobile
