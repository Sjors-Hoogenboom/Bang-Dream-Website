This is a fan made website about the game/ serie Bang Dream Girls Band Party

This website is for a school project, only html, css and javascript, no div or span and no library's

The website will never sell anything on it, the webshop is purely a mock webshop


Features currently in the working:

-Webshop item tracker/ order form, needs improvement, needs to show cart and total price still


Features that will be worked on in the future:

-Song page
-Information page about all the webshop items, or an info button on the webshop item
-change webshop grid to 3 per row and add more items
-Switch character outfits normal outfit ---> band

Might abandon the website if I get a decent grade, not sure yet
