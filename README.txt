This is a fan made website about the game/ serie Bang Dream Girls Band Party

This website is for school, I'm not allowed to use anything besides plain html, css and javascript and even after finishing this subject, I intend to keep only using plain html, css and javascript
Also no website design programs, no imports and no divs or span (only if really necessary)

I had no prior experience with webdesign, so this is my first (semi) serious website, please take the janky code with a grain of salt

The website will never sell anything on it, the webshop is one of the requirements for the subject




Features currently in the working:

-Webshop item tracker/ order form
-Fix the console bug in every page that doesn't contain a searchbar


Features that will be worked on in the near future:

-Song page
-Information page about all the webshop items
-Fix the footer
-Fix the file structure (a css file for every page)
-Fix the font on mobile
